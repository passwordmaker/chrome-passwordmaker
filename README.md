# PasswordMaker Pro

![Example Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/OxCD9TN.png)

The only thing which kept me from completely switching to Chrome was a missing port of the [passwordmaker.org](http://www.passwordmaker.org/) extension.
There was one available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passwordmaker/doblembglfahhpiilfhajboogopikhcm) but sadly, that extension is only a simple port of the HTML page which is offered on [passwordmaker.org](http://www.passwordmaker.org/passwordmaker.html).

This extension fixes that.  This is a native Chrome port with all the bells and whistles you'd expect!

# Installation

### Chrome
  - You can install this extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passwordmaker-pro/lnhofcfhehhcbccpmdmdpjncdoihmkkh) from it's new home.

### Opera
  - You can install this extension from the [Opera Extension Gallery](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/passwordmaker-pro/)

If you have previously used the Firefox Extension, you can directly import your .rdf file.

# Status of this project

## Update 2014-07-13 by [@heavensrevenge](https://github.com/heavensrevenge)

I am the new and active maintainer of this project and I have uploaded this extension back to the Chrome Web Store which is located at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passwordmaker-pro/lnhofcfhehhcbccpmdmdpjncdoihmkkh

**_PLEASE Export your profile data_** to be sure you have a back-up of your data which you can import into the most current version.
I apologize for any problems the disappearance from the Chrome Web Store may have caused, but I will do my best to keep this extension alive and well.

I don't use this plug-in anymore and do not have the time or energy to continue maintainership.
I'm out. It was a nice ride.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests:

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Commit, do not mess with version in manifest.json
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
