# Chrome PasswordMaker Pro

![Example Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/hjcdo4L.png)

The only thing that kept me from switching to Chrome completely was a missing port of the [passwordmaker.org](http://www.passwordmaker.org/) extension. Luckily, there was one available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passwordmaker/doblembglfahhpiilfhajboogopikhcm). Sadly, that extension is only a simple port of the HTML page that is offered on [passwordmaker.org](http://www.passwordmaker.org/passwordmaker.html).

This extension fixes that. It's a real port with all the bells and whistles you'd expect.

# Installation

You can install this plug-in from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passwordmaker-pro/lnhofcfhehhcbccpmdmdpjncdoihmkkh) from its new home.

## Update 2014-07-13 by @heavensrevenge

I have uploaded the extension back to the Chrome Web Store and its new URL/ID is https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passwordmaker-pro/lnhofcfhehhcbccpmdmdpjncdoihmkkh

**_PLEASE Export your profile data ASAP_** to be sure you have a back-up of your data to import into the new 0.7.x version. 
I apologize for any horrible problems the disappearance from the Chrome Web Store may have caused, but I will do my best to keep this extension alive.

## Update 2014-07-12 by @bitboxer

Sadly I don't have enough time to continue working on this. I got a few pull requests
by [@heavensrevenge](http://github.com/heavensrevenge) and sadly some of those broke things.
I don't use this plug-in anymore and do not have the time or energy to continue maintainership.

So I'll do what I think is the most responsible thing to do: remove it from the chrome
app store and stop working on this. There are several users here on this organization
who have write access to the code, so I hope they will continue working on this and
re-release this to the chrome web store and hopefully fix the remaining bugs
this plug-in had at the time I write this.

I'm out. It was a nice ride. But I can't continue to do a half-assed job on this.
