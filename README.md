# Chrome PasswordMaker Pro

![Example Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/4dhnDEK.png)

The only thing that kept me from switching to Chrome completely was a missing port of the [passwordmaker.org](http://www.passwordmaker.org/) extension. Luckily, there was one available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passwordmaker/doblembglfahhpiilfhajboogopikhcm). Sadly, that extension is only a simple port of the HTML page that is offered on [passwordmaker.org](http://www.passwordmaker.org/passwordmaker.html).

This extension fixes that. It's a real port with all the bells and whistles you'd expect.

# Status of this project

## Update 2014-07-12 by @bitboxer

Sadly I don't have enough time to continue working on this. I got a few pull requests
by [@heavensrevenge](http://github.com/heavensrevenge). Sadly some of those broke things. I should have tested this
more thoroughly, but I don't have the energy to do it. I don't use this plugin anymore.

So I do what I think is the most responsible thing to do: remove it from the chrome
app store and stop working on this. There are several users here on this organization
who have write access to the code, so I hope they will continue working on this and
re releasing this to the chrome webstore. And hopefully without the buggy releases
this plugin had sadly.

I'm out. It was a nice ride. But I can't continue to do a half-assed job on this.
